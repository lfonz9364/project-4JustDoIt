# Conference Carpooling
This site is currently hosted on Heroku https://mysterious-bastion-51155.herokuapp.com/;

## Overview
This application has the aim of supporting and give value to a conference website.
We decide to cover the transport segment. With our app all the people attending the conference:
* If with a car can share it and travel with same "new friends";
* With not car they can find a ride;
* All together they can reduce pollution sharing a ride and minimising the number of cars around!

## Approach
1. As a group of four we started with a brain storming to bring together all our ideas;
2. According to the time available we decided what features to work on;
3. We created "user stories" in Trello;
4. We drawn all the wireframe and tables needed, we assigned tasks for each one and picked a GitLord;
5. Started;
6. Git pull, Git Add, Git commit, Git push, and so on and on and on...until the end!
